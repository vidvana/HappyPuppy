It was mostly successful but the animal pissed on the PAs leg. Not sure if it is a good sign.
The PA was taken by an ambulance after the animal bit off a part of their calf.
The animal was really shy but at the end they allowed to pet themselves.
The animal jumped on the PA out of excitement. The PA tripped over but they seemed very happy.
The animal almost froze out of boredom. The PA did not seem to mind it though.
